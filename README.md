# ADNI3-Blueprints

Source code for processing diffusion MRI data of ADNI3 (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) study and performing brain connectivity blueprints and tractography:

- Shared scripts include preprocessing and processing steps of diffusion MRI data.
- Data requirements from ADNI3: T1-weighted and diffusion MRI data with corresponding bvecs & bvals
- The following is the pipeline's flowchart proposed for T1W and diffusion MRI data.

This source code is open for anyone to use and reproduce. Hope you find this helpful!
